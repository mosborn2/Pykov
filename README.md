The bot produces a pastiche of texts written by Roberto Bolaño, edited by Ignacio Echevarria, and translated by Natasha Wimmer, collected in [Between Parentheses](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9550623-between-parentheses)

Major thanks go out to everyone involved in getting Bolaño's books into the english language and onto my bookshelves.
